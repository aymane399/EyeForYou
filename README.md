   ## Launch Program
   
Code Material of EyeForYou Project

First, install opencv and other modules using this command 

`pip install  -r requirements.txt`

For running the program, use this command

`sudo python3 main.py`

Important : the sudo is necessary because of the "keyboard" module, which 
only works on root
